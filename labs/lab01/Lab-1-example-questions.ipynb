In python, `n%10` is the remainder when dividing `n` by 10, which is just the rightmost digit of `n`. Multiplying the reversed integer by 10 and adding the rightmost digit from `n` effectively appends the digit to the reversed number. Then you divide `n` by 10 with integer division to remove the rightmost digit from `n`. After the last digit is processed, `n` will be 0 so the loop ends.
